    This is a test harness for checking the behaviour of different browsers when printing to PDF. Where some browsers
    make requests for assets again, but without session cookies, and this can cause a user's session to be wiped. So far
    just reported in IE11.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    We need to put something constant (time you logged in that's displayed above when authenticated) in the session and
    display it above because play modifies the session cookie on each request, which makes it difficult to see if a
    totally new session has been started.</p>
